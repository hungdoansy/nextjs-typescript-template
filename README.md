This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This already has `ESLint@8.20.0`, `Prettier@2.7.1` and `Typescript@4.7.4` installed.

## Getting Started

My personal recommendation

```json
"engines": {
    "node": "^14.0.0",
    "pnpm": "^7.0.0"
},
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or (recommended)
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
